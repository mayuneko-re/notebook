# Criteria
From ***Taber, Martin and Seright (1996)***

- Gravity API: >22
- Viscosity: <10 cp
- Composition: High % of C5-C12
- Oil saturation: >35 %PV

# Mechanisms

- Swelling the crude oil
  - Swelling of trapped oil even when shielded by water (***Campbell, 1983***)
- Reducing oil viscosity
- Reducing the gas-oil interfacial tension
  - Effect of interfacial tension on oil recovery by CO2 floods (***Shyeh-Yung, 1991***)
- Vaporizing (Extracting) lighter hydrocarbons in crude oil
- Generating miscibility by the multiple contact process if pressure is high enough

# Physical properties of CO2

- CO2 equilibrium curve: Pressure vs Temperature (***Holm, 1987 and 1989***)
- CO2 density: density vs pressure (***Goodrich, 1980***)
- Viscosity: Viscosity vs pressure (***Goodrich, 1980***)
- Space occupied by CO2 at reservoir temperatures and pressures: Reservoir bbls per MSCF of CO2 vs Pressure (***Goodrich, 1980***)
  
# Interactions with oil
